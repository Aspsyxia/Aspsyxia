### Hey hey 👋

I'm an IT graduate and indie game developer.

For the most part I use **C#** and I'm currently getting up to speed with Java, but I have experience with other languages like Python, C, C++, Prolog and R.
I'm also pretty good at creating 3D graphics using Blender and have experience with web development using CSS, HTML and JS.

If you want to see games that me and my friend made so far, check our [itch.io](https://travmasoft.itch.io) page
